Added three new features to the color palette generator to make it more flexible and fun to use. First, I added a manual color picker inside each color box, so now you can pick your own colors using a built-in color input. It updates the box and text automatically, and even works on locked colors. Second, I added a slider to let you choose how many color blocks you want to see ‚Äî anywhere between 3 and 8. This setting is saved and stays the same next time you open the page. Lastly, I made it possible to rearrange the color blocks by dragging them around. This uses drag-and-drop with Sortable.js and saves the new order right away, so you can organize your colors however you like. These updates make the tool more customizable and user-friendly.
