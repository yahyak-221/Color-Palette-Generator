I added several exciting features to my color palette tool! First, I made the toast notifications smarter by adjusting the font color based on background for better readability. Then I included a manual color picker so users can pick exact shades. I also added a slider to choose how many colors (3‚Äì8) to generate. Drag-and-drop sorting using Sortable.js makes rearranging colors super smooth. I improved the saved palettes so clicking a saved color now copies it instead of generating a new one. Lastly, I built a ‚ÄúShare Palette‚Äù feature ‚Äî it generates a custom link with the color codes in the URL and copies it for easy sharing!
